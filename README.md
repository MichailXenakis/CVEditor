# CVEditor

The main goal of this project is to develop CVEditor, an application
that makes this task easier, especially for young inexperienced people such as graduate and
undergraduate students. At a glance, CVEditor shall allow a user to prepare a new CV based on well
known templates (chronological, functional, combination), change the structure of an existing CV by
switching between these templates, generate actual CV documents in well known formats (simple text,
Latex [8,9,10]), trace changes between different CV versions and so on.
